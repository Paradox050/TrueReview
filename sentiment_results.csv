"The phone was repeatedly hanging. Repeatedly asked Amazon for replacement, but citing some or the other technical issue, they did not replace. Once the the return window was closed, they said they could not help. Had to then approach Apple customer care.

0. Defective product delivered
1. Amazon made it almost impossible to reach their customer service by making the waiting period for call very long and repeatedly cutting the call.
2. Citing technical issues they did not replace the phone till the replacement window was closed
3. Once the replacement window closed, they blamed me for the delay in getting the product replaced
